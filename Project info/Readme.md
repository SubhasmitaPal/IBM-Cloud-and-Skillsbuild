## How I created a Fitness Buddy- AI Coach using IBM Watson Cloud ##

##1.Defined the Concept & Problem
  Identified the need for a personalized AI fitness assistant that offers workouts, meal ideas, and motivation based on user goals and     preferences.
2.Set Up IBM Cloud Lite Environment
  Created a free IBM Cloud Lite account and configured the Watsonx.ai Agent Lab workspace for development.
3.Designed the AI Agent in Watsonx
  Wrote a system prompt defining the agent’s role as “Fitness Buddy – AI Health Coach.”
  Added tools for text, image, and feedback-based inputs.
4.Tested in Agent Lab Preview
  Used sample queries (workout, nutrition, motivation) to verify response quality.
  Iteratively refined prompts and instructions for accuracy and personalization.
5.Deployed the Agent
  Published the AI agent to IBM Machine Learning Deployment Space.
  Generated a public endpoint URL for real-time access.
6.Enhanced Interaction with Voice & Image Input
  Integrated browser voice-to-text (Web Speech API) for easy voice queries.
  Enabled image-based prompts for meal/nutrition analysis where supported.
7.Prepared Demo & Documentation
  Created a live demo in Watsonx Preview showcasing workouts, meals, and motivational responses.
  Documented the entire process with screenshots, results, and future scope for improvements. ##
